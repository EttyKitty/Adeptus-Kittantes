# Credits and thanks to:

EttyKitty (Sayurime) - the developer. So with all blame come to me.

bulletdesigner and ohartenstein23 - developers of the '40k' mod.
Buscher and Leflair - developers of the 'ROSIGMA' submod. They helped me a lot with the advises and ideas.

Dioxine - developer of the 'X-Piratez' mod, from which I took some sprites, code parts and ideas.
Solarius Scorch - developer of the 'X-Com Files' mod, from which I also took some ideas and sprites.
- Both the 'X-Piratez' and the 'X-Com Files' are great mods, in which I spent a lot of my time, so a separate big thanks to those guys.

Meridian and Yankes - developers of the OXCE.
- Nothing even should be said. If not for these guys - a lot of the things would've been impossible.
