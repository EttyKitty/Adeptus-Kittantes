# Adeptus-Kittantes
A set of different additions/changes for the 40K and ROSIGMA OpenXcom mods.
## Features:
- Soon
## Dev. Team:
**EttyKitty** (**Sayurime**) - main developer. So with all of the blame come to me.
## Credits and thanks to:
**bulletdesigner** and **ohartenstein23** - developers of the '40k' mod.  
**Buscher and Leflair** - developers of the 'ROSIGMA' submod. They helped me a lot with the advises and ideas.  
**Firaa** - developer of the '40k "Melee" Weapon Pack' and 'Randomized Stat Caps for Soldiers' mods. Some of his work is used by me.  
**Dioxine** - developer of the 'X-Piratez' mod, from which I took some sprites, code parts and ideas.  
**Solarius Scorch** - developer of the 'X-Com Files' mod, from which I also took some ideas and sprites.
- Both the 'X-Piratez' and the 'X-Com Files' are great mods, in which I spent a lot of my time, so a separate big thanks to those guys.  
**Meridian** and **Yankes** - developers of the OXCE.
- Nothing even should be said. If not for these guys - a lot of the things simply wouldn't be possible to implement.
