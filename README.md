# Adeptus-Kittantes
A set of different additions/changes for the 40K and ROSIGMA OXCE mods.

## Features (of this branch):
- No female marines. I don't like them.
- "Brother" at the start of marine names. It's easier this way to differ unit types.
- A lot of items removed from the shop/hidden from the CODEX. Mostly guardsmen/human sized stuff.
- Outpost are not available from the start. Purely for de-clutter purpose.

## A Short F.A.Q:
> How serious am I?

Not serious at all.
   
I'm in a good mood. I'm having fun. I do things.  
I'm in a normal mood. I'm not having fun. I don't do things.  

It's as simple as that.

> What are the branches?

**Main** - tested and playable additions.  
**Development** - additions in the process of testing, should be playable, not very stable/balanced.  
**Test Cave** - things I throw away because of some reasons, but not forever.  

> What about other factions aside from the SM?

Other factions are not endorsed by me. I try to "not break" them, but not always and it's not my priority. 

First, I fix the SM to my liking, find my paradigms inside of every gameplay mechanic, then I will think about others. Step-by-step.

> How good am I with the sprite work/coding?

Very bad.

## Developers:
**EttyKitty** (**Sayurime**) - main developer. So with all of the blame come to me.

## Credits and thanks to:
**bulletdesigner** and **ohartenstein23** - developers of the '40k' mod.  

**Buscher and Leflair** - developers of the 'ROSIGMA' submod. They helped me a lot with the advises and ideas.  

**Firaa** - developer of the '40k "Melee" Weapon Pack' and 'Randomized Stat Caps for Soldiers' mods. Some of his work is used by me.  

**Dioxine** - developer of the 'X-Piratez' mod, from which I took some sprites, code parts and ideas.  

**Solarius Scorch** - developer of the 'X-Com Files' mod, from which I also took some ideas and sprites.  
Both the 'X-Piratez' and the 'X-Com Files' are great mods, in which I spent a lot of my time, so a separate big thanks to those guys.  

**Meridian** and **Yankes** - developers of the OXCE.  
Nothing even should be said. If not for these guys - a lot of the things simply wouldn't be possible to implement.
